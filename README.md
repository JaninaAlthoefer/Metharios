# Metharios
Metharios is a student team project. It's a digital tabletop card game. 

I was involved in the project during September 2016 and June/July 2017.
My roles involved the adjustment of exisiting rules for the digital version, preparing the 3D assets for the game and implementing the sound & particle effects.
