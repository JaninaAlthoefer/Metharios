# Metharios
Metharios is a student team project. It's a digital tabletop card game. 

The game is similar to a fantasy card game version of chess, wherein each of the two players can summon creatures to attack the other. 

I was involved in the project during September 2016 and June/July 2017. 

My roles involved the adjustment of exisiting rules for the digital version, preparing the 3D assets for the game and implementing the sound & particle effects.


Developed in Unity3D.
